# Thermodynamics Computation Package

This project was developed by Eric Hou and
is a python package that will provide
computational functions to assist with various 
areas in chemical engineering thermodynamics. The
intent of this package is to act as an aid for
professors and students in the classroom and 
potentially help with calculations in certain
industries.

Currently, functions exist for various methods to
calculate volumetric properties of pure fluids and
heat effects. Additionally, functions covering:
entropy computation, solution thermodynamics, 
mixing, phase equilibrium, vapor liquid equilibrium,
and reaction equilibrium will be added.<br>
Note: this project has not yet been converted into
a functioning package

The content of this package is heavily based on the
teachings of *Introduction to Chemical Engineering
Thermodynamics* by Smith, Van Ness, Abbott, and 
Swihart.

## Testing
All testing is currently located in the tests folder
where each file contains the test cases for the 
methods in its corresponding source code file.
All functions are to have multiple test cases with
at least two cases with the result matching the same
case done by hand. In addition, boundary cases will
be tested if needed
<br>
## Documentaion
Most of the documentation will be done in the form of
python docstring. Each file will list a summary,
version, and author. Each function will have a short
description as well as the parameters and returns.
In addition, inline comments will be added to 
describe test cases and other code.
